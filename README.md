## Detecting Mental Disorders on Twitter

## Overview

My final project for a class at Northwestern (Optimization for Machine Learning and Deep Learning) involved pursing a machine learning curiosity.  I decided to research further on text sentiment analysis, particularly learning about the problem in the prediction of mental disorders in social media. While research has shown that throughout the decades, rates of diagnosing mental illness have improved, many cases remain undetected. Further, I have recently been interested in utilizing machine learning/deep learning tools to address this problem and propose technological solutions to try to ameliorate the issue. In the recent age of technology, social media is a popular outlet for people to express their emotions. Moreover, symptoms of mental disorders have shown to be observable through the text in these outlets. Prior studies have indicated that individuals with mental illnesses show deviations in normal language.   

Further, I became interested in researching how to analyze, build, and optimize  machine learning/deep learning models that would predict mental disorders in social media. The research was very involved as I am new to the field of NLP. I then determined the best learning tool was to utilize a project that detects politcal sentiment shown [here](https://github.com/RonKG/Machine-Learning-Projects-2/tree/master/3.%20NLP_twitter_sentiment_analysis) and modified it to focus on my problem, which is identify the words/phrases that indicate a mental disorder. The result is shown [here](https://github.com/vnoelifant/twitter_detect_depression/blob/master/Twitter_Mental_Disorder_Detection.ipynb). 

## ConclusionsÂ¶
We can see in the results that we have while not a very high accuracy score, the score is not bad, and it's convincing to say we have a good, working algorithm for detecting whether tweets are prone to having a mental disorder. The prediction results are a bit mixed, but at least we do see expected results. However improvements should be explored in the future to enhance the predictions. With the researched machine learning tools, and available models, I believe this project is a great example to build upon further.

## Next steps:
Use more models, such as LSTM CNN to see if the prediction is more accurate, find improved datasets, such as finding those with true labels of mental disorders, figure out alternate ways in pulling test data that may improve the detection (I likely need much more data), predict the actual mental disorder, enhance text/feature exraction, use more labels, such as neutral sentiment labels, explore emojis, research how supportive chat bots can be integrated during real time detection, perhaps with Twitter's Streaming API.
